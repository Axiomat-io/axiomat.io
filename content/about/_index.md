## Co-Founder/Head of Sales - Drew Meyer
![hbd](/images/hbd.jpeg)

Drew, our head of business development, is the epitome of a tech sales bro. With his perfectly coiffed hair, designer suits, and an extensive collection of fidget spinners, he's always ready to close the deal with a fist bump and a "brofessional" high-five. Rumor has it that he once closed a million-dollar deal while doing a backflip on a hoverboard. When he's not crushing sales targets, you can find him at the gym, bench-pressing servers and flexing his biceps in the server room mirror.

Drew is currently lost at sea after attempting to sail to California from Florida. We suspect he got "distracted" somewhere in Central America.

Keeping a buisness running is hard work, but someone has to do it.  Might as well be Andrew.  He's been doing it for years, and has a track record of success.  He's also a pretty good golfer.

AJ is based in the Twin Cities, Minnesota.
